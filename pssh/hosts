# For use with pssh
# Lines in the host file are of the form [user@]host[:port] and 
# can include blank lines and comments (lines beginning with "#"). 
# If multiple host files are given (the -h option is used more 
# than once), then pssh behaves as though these files were 
# concatenated together. If a host is specified multiple times, 
# then pssh will connect the given number of times.
